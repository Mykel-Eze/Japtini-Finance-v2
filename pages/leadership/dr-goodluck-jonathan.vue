              the administration of Umaru Musa Yar'Adua; and in the oil-rich Bayelsa State as Governor of Bayelsa State

              Under Jonathan's administration, Nigeria rebased its gross domestic product for the first time in
              over a decade, becoming the largest economy in Africa by overtaking South Africa and Egypt. The
              Jonathan-led administration accrued over US$454 billion while in office from oil revenue. Jonathan
              previously served as an assistant director at the Oil Mineral Producing Areas Development Commission
              between 1993 and 1998. On 2 August 2010, Jonathan launched his 'Roadmap for Power Sector Reform'.
              Its primary goal was to achieve stable electricity supply in Nigeria.

            <p>
              During Jonathan's administration, Nigeria's foreign policy was reviewed to reflect a "citizen-focused"
              approach, designed to "accord this vision of defending the dignity of humanity the highest priority"
              and connect foreign policy to domestic policy, while placing a greater emphasis on economic diplomacy.

            <p>
              In June 2019, Goodluck Jonathan was named chairperson of the International Summit Council for Peace.
              In July 2020, he was appointed special envoy of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS);
              to lead mediation talks during the 2020 Malian protests.
